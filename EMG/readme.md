EMG data collection:

We collected three conditions using the Biometrics EMG system.

1) FDI-1.txt - measurement from the R FDI muscle. First rested the hand on the table, then produced moderate abduction against resistance. This file is used to characterize the AC noise and demonstrate procedures for onset detection in EMG. Also, this condition is used to show how to calculate RMS of EMG and rectified EMG signal. Sampling rate 1000 Hz, sensitivity 3V.

2) Carl_1.txt - flexion-extension of the elbow while holding a 10 lb weight. The EMG sensor placed on the biceps, with concurrent goniometer measurement of the elbow angle (more negative - flexion). The purpose of the condition is to compare the mean EMG amplitude during the concentric vs. eccentric part of the movement.

3) Carl_2.txt - participant maintained 90 degree angle at the elbow, while holding 20 lb mass in hand. The goal is to compare the median frequency at the beginning vs. end of the hold.
