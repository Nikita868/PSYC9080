Description of the data collection:

FDI-1.txt - measurement from the R FDI muscle. First rested the hand on the table, then produced moderate abduction against resistance. This file is used to characterize the AC noise and demonstrate RMS and Onset detection using EMG. Sampling rate 1000 Hz, sensitivity 3V.

Carl_1 - flexion-extension of the elbow while holding a 10 lb weight. The EMG sensor placed on the biceps, with concurrent goniometer measurement of the elbow angle (more negative - flexion).

Carl_2 - maintained 90 degree angle at the elbow, while holding 20 lb. The goal is to compare the median frequency at the beginning vs. end of the hold.
